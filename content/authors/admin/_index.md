    # summary: |
    #   I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural networkâ€™s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

## About Me

I am a postdoc at UBC. I completed my PhD and MSc in Computing Science at the [RLAI Lab](http://rlai.ualberta.ca/) at the University of Alberta, advised by Professor [Martha White](http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~whitem/). My primary research focus is on offline reinforcement learning. I am broadly interested in applying machine learning and reinforcement learning to solve real-world decision-making problems.
